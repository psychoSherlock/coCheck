# CO-Check
## Simple covid vaccine checker without OTP (For Indians)
### Check it out here, <https://co-check.herokuapp.com> it may take some time to load, as it is hosted on heroku free plan.

### The script was meant to be checking data on server-side(or backend)
### But unfortunatey, the Indian cowin api doesnot allow non-indians to check for vaccines,(and I dont know why).
### So I had to make it client side. I dont want to handle dynamic urls so I had flask to handle it itself so I dont have to worry

### You can checkout the server side code on the branch ```main```

### All suggestions are appreciated, even though no one cares about my code ðŸ˜“

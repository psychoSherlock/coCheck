# CO-Check

## Sample covid vaccine checker

### The script was meant to be checking data on server-side(or backend)
### But unfortunatey, the indian cowin api doesnot allow non-indians to check for vaccines,(and I dont know why).
### So I had to make it client side. I dont want to handle dynamic urls so I had flask to handle it itself so I dont have to worry

### You can checkout the server side code on the branch ```server-side```
